	<p>a.café is a sophisticated take on a European-style café and espresso bar, serving artisan coffees, organic loose-leaf teas, brunch and lunch. The café offers a superb menu and emphasizes fresh, healthy options with frequent seasonal updates.</p></td>
	<h5>This weekend's special brunch</h5>
<p>This was a strange place. Walked in after a day in Central Park, and as its conveniently located near the Plaza I thought it might be a nice place for coffee and lunch. It's very modern inside,</p>
